# 383Project - App Technical Test

## Background
This test is designed to focus on assessing how developers approach certain tasks, whilst also demonstrating programming
capability, followed by displaying knowledge of the languages/frameworks/packages.

The use of well supported, open source packages is allowed.

You should complete this test yourself and shouldn't outsource any of the work.

## Technical
We primarily use React Native for our all based system. We are also looking out for libraries such as Redux, React Navigation and the Expo framework.

## The Task

> Note: This is entirely fictional and none of the results from the test will be used by 383Project.

Our client would like an app developed that allows for retrieval of weather forecasts

There would be further phases of development to introduce this, but the client would like a phase 1 for an initial release.

The client has no specific requirements in terms of design.

## Phase 1

  - Screen 1 - Allow the user to pull and display weather forecasts from the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for the 
week in the users preferred location.
  - Screen 2 - Be able to select a single day in order to display more information for that day and be able to change the location
  - Screen 3 - Save and show a list of your favourite cities

## Submission

The resulting repository can either be submitted via GitHub, bitbucket. We also recommend adding run and build instruction to a Readme document.
